Does it sometimes annoy you to reveal a source of iron next to a perfect array of mountains and losing the ability to place
a campus? In my eyes it is unrealistic that it is possible to strip an area of all its stone, but not to remove some horses.

This mod fixes that by allowing all luxury and strategic resources to be harvested (although for miniscule yields) and also allowing for them to be placed on geothermal fissures and oases (a campus will not benefit from being placed directly on a geothermal fissure however). 

The respective harvest technologies mostly correspond to the unlocking technology, excluding celesial navigation harvests. 

The AI can in theory make use of these changes, but will by my testing not often do so.
